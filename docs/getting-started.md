# Getting Started

## Launching Cronboard

After [installing](installation.md), start the application with:

```bash
cronboard
```

The app reads your user crontab on startup. If you have no cron jobs yet, the table will be empty; you can add your first job in a few steps (see [Your First Cron Job](#your-first-cron-job)).

---

## Interface Overview

When Cronboard opens you will see a single window with a header, tab bar, main table, and footer. The layout is fixed so you always know where to look.

- **Header** — shows the app name and current version. Useful to confirm you’re running the version you expect.
- **Tab bar** — switch between **Local** (your local cron jobs) and **Servers** (remote SSH servers). Only one tab is active at a time; the main table shows the jobs for the active tab.
- **Main table** — lists all cron jobs with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| ID | The comment/identifier attached to the job |
| Expression | The raw cron expression (e.g. `0 * * * *`) |
| Command | The shell command that runs |
| Last Run | When the job last ran |
| Next Run | When the job will run next |
| Status | `Active`, `Paused`, or `Inactive` |

- **Footer** — displays all available keyboard bindings for the current context. The bindings change depending on whether you’re in the table, a form, or the Servers panel, so it’s worth glancing at the footer when you switch context.

## Your First Cron Job

Creating a job is the main way to get started. The flow is the same for local and remote (after connecting to a server).

1. Press **`c`** to open the **Create** form. The form has three fields: Expression, Command, and ID.
2. Enter a valid cron expression in the **Expression** field (e.g. `0 * * * *` for every hour).  
   As you type, a human-readable description appears below the field in real time (e.g. *"Every hour"*). This helps you confirm the schedule before saving.
3. Enter the **Command** to execute. Use **`Tab`** to autocomplete file paths so you don’t have to type full paths by hand.
4. Give the job a unique **ID** (stored as a crontab comment). The ID helps you recognize the job in the table and in raw `crontab -l` output.
5. Press **Save**.

The table refreshes automatically and your new job appears immediately. No need to restart the app.

## Switching Between Local and Remote

Use the **`Tab`** key to switch focus between panels, or click the **Local** / **Servers** tabs at the top.

- **Local** — manages your current user's crontab. Changes are written directly to your system crontab.
- **Servers** — lists saved SSH servers. Add servers once; they’re stored in config so you can reconnect anytime. See [Remote Servers](features/remote-servers.md) for setup and connecting.

## Quitting

Press **`q`** or **`Ctrl+Q`** to exit Cronboard. Your crontab (and any remote crontabs you edited) are already saved; there is no separate “save before quit” step.
