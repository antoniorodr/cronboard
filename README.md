## 🛠️ Technologies

The project is built with:

- [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io)

- [Paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)
- [cron-descriptor](https://github.com/Salamek/cron-descriptor)

## 📋 Requirements

Before starting, make sure `cron` is installed and available on your machine:

```bash
crontab -l
```

If you install Cronboard with `pip` or `uv`, you also need Python 3.13 or newer.

## 📦 Installation

### Manual installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoniorodr/cronboard
cd cronboard
pip install .
```

### Homebrew installation

```bash
brew install cronboard
```

### Installation with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/antoniorodr/cronboard
```

### AUR installation

```bash
yay -S cronboard
```

### Nix installation

```bash
nix profile add github:antoniorodr/cronboard
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once installed, run:

```bash
cronboard
```

Cronboard includes a footer, provided by [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io), that shows the available commands.

> [!note]
> When connecting to a remote server with an SSH key, Cronboard looks for the `known_hosts` file in the default location: `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

> [!important]
> If you choose to manage cron jobs for another user, make sure you have the necessary permissions. In practice, that means you need `sudo` access.

### ⌨️ Autocompletion

Path autocompletion when creating or editing cron jobs helps you enter file paths faster.

The default starting point for autocompletion is the home directory of the user whose cron jobs you are managing. Accept a suggestion with the `Tab` key.
